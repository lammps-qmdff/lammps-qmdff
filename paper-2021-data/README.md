Supplementary files related to the case studies presented in the paper "Exploiting the Quantum Mechanically Derived Force Field for Functional Materials Simulations".

To run QMDFF simulations in LAMMPS, following input files are required:
* **{name}_entry.data** - initial coordinates and topology of the system.
* **{name}_coeffs.data** - definition of the force field parameters.
* **{name}_c6.tbl** - tables with van-der-Waals potentials.
* **{name}_excl.tbl** - tables with the potentials for bonds and angles.
* **{name}_dih.tbl** - tables with the potentials for proper dihedral angles.
* **{name}.in** - input settings for MD run.

The directories contain input and other supplementary files for the case studies:
* **solvents** - validation of the QMDFF performance on the properties of liquid solvents with different values of the repulsion scaling parameter.
* **ADN** - crosslinking reaction in ADN.
* **PMMA** - morphology of doped PMMA-based materials and dissociation of the dopants.
* **HfMMA** - morphology of the amorphous HfMMA-based photoresist material.

Inside every directory, the content is divided into several subdirectories:
* **input_files** -  .data and .in files required to start the simulations.
* **tables** - compressed .tbl files referenced in .data files.
* **output_coordinates** - final snapshots of MD trajectories, in .pdb format.
* **FF** - force field parameters (.solvent) and logs (.qmdff) generated by the *qmdff* utility of S. Grimme.
