4. Packages :h3

This section gives an overview of the optional packages that extend
LAMMPS functionality with instructions on how to build LAMMPS with
each of them.  Packages are groups of files that enable a specific set
of features.  For example, force fields for molecular systems or
granular systems are in packages.  You can see the list of all
packages and "make" commands to manage them by typing "make package"
from within the src directory of the LAMMPS distribution.  "Section
2.3"_Section_start.html#start_3 gives general info on how to install
and un-install packages as part of the LAMMPS build process.

There are two kinds of packages in LAMMPS, standard and user packages:

"Table of standard packages"_#table_standard
"Table of user packages"_#table_user :ul

Standard packages are supported by the LAMMPS developers and are
written in a syntax and style consistent with the rest of LAMMPS.
This means the developers will answer questions about them, debug and
fix them if necessary, and keep them compatible with future changes to
LAMMPS.

User packages have been contributed by users, and begin with the
"user" prefix.  If they are a single command (single file), they are
typically in the user-misc package.  User packages don't necessarily
meet the requirements of the standard packages.  If you have problems
using a feature provided in a user package, you may need to contact
the contributor directly to get help.  Information on how to submit
additions you make to LAMMPS as single files or as a standard or user
package are given in "this section"_Section_modify.html#mod_15 of the
manual.

Following the next two tables is a sub-section for each package.  It
lists authors (if applicable) and summarizes the package contents.  It
has specific instructions on how to install the package, including (if
necessary) downloading or building any extra library it requires. It
also gives links to documentation, example scripts, and
pictures/movies (if available) that illustrate use of the package.

NOTE: To see the complete list of commands a package adds to LAMMPS,
just look at the files in its src directory, e.g. "ls src/GRANULAR".
Files with names that start with fix, compute, atom, pair, bond,
angle, etc correspond to commands with the same style names.

In these two tables, the "Example" column is a sub-directory in the
examples directory of the distribution which has an input script that
uses the package.  E.g. "peptide" refers to the examples/peptide
directory; USER/atc refers to the examples/USER/atc directory.  The
"Library" column indicates whether an extra library is needed to build
and use the package:

dash = no library
sys = system library: you likely have it on your machine
int = internal library: provided with LAMMPS, but you may need to build it
ext = external library: you will need to download and install it on your machine :ul

GPU package :link(GPU),h4

[Contents:]

Dozens of pair styles and a version of the PPPM long-range Coulombic
solver optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.  All such styles have a "gpu" as a
suffix in their style name.  "Section 5.3.1"_accelerate_gpu.html gives
details of what hardware and Cuda software is required on your system,
and details on how to build and use this package.  Its styles can be
invoked at run time via the "-sf gpu" or "-suffix gpu" "command-line
switches"_Section_start.html#start_7.  See also the "KOKKOS"_#KOKKOS
package, which has GPU-enabled styles.

[Authors:] Mike Brown (Intel) while at Sandia and ORNL and Trung Nguyen
(Northwestern U) while at ORNL.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the GPU
library in lib/gpu from a set of provided C and Cuda files.  You can
do this manually if you prefer; follow the instructions in
lib/gpu/README.  You can also do it in one step from the lammps/src
dir, using a command like these, which simply invoke the
lib/gpu/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-gpu                                # print help message
make lib-gpu args="-m"                      # build GPU library with default Makefile.linux
make lib-gpu args="-i xk7 -p single -o xk7.single"      # create new Makefile.xk7.single, altered for single-precision
make lib-gpu args="-i xk7 -p single -o xk7.single -m"   # ditto, also build GPU library

Note that this procedure starts with one of the existing
Makefile.machine files in lib/gpu.  It allows you to alter 4 important
settings in that Makefile, via the -h, -a, -p, -e switches,
and save the new Makefile, if desired:

CUDA_HOME = where NVIDIA Cuda software is installed on your system
CUDA_ARCH = what GPU hardware you have (see help message for details)
CUDA_PRECISION = precision (double, mixed, single)
EXTRAMAKE = which Makefile.lammps.* file to copy to Makefile.lammps :ul

If the library build is successful, 2 files should be created:
lib/gpu/libgpu.a and lib/gpu/Makefile.lammps.  The latter has settings
that enable LAMMPS to link with Cuda libraries.  If the settings in
Makefile.lammps for your machine are not correct, the LAMMPS build
will fail.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-gpu
make machine :pre

make no-gpu
make machine :pre

NOTE: If you re-build the GPU library in lib/gpu, you should always
un-install the GPU package, then re-install it and re-build LAMMPS.
This is because the compilation of files in the GPU package use the
library settings from the lib/gpu/Makefile.machine used to build the
GPU library.

KIM package :link(KIM),h4

[Contents:]

A "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command which is a wrapper on the
Knowledge Base for Interatomic Models (KIM) repository of interatomic
potentials, enabling any of them to be used in LAMMPS simulations.

To use this package you must have the KIM library available on your
system.

Information about the KIM project can be found at its website:
https://openkim.org.  The KIM project is led by Ellad Tadmor and Ryan
Elliott (U Minnesota) and James Sethna (Cornell U).

[Authors:] Ryan Elliott (U Minnesota) is the main developer for the KIM
API which the "pair_style kim"_pair_kim.html command uses.  He
developed the pair style in collaboration with Valeriu Smirichinski (U
Minnesota).

[Install or un-install:]

Using this package requires the KIM library and its models
(interatomic potentials) to be downloaded and installed on your
system.  The library can be downloaded and built in lib/kim or
elsewhere on your system.  Details of the download, build, and install
process for KIM are given in the lib/kim/README file.

Once that process is complete, you can then install/un-install the
package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner:

make yes-kim
make machine :pre

make no-kim

KOKKOS package :link(KOKKOS),h4

[Contents:]

Dozens of atom, pair, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, fix, compute
styles adapted to compile using the Kokkos library which can convert
them to OpenMP or Cuda code so that they run efficiently on multicore
CPUs, KNLs, or GPUs.  All the styles have a "kk" as a suffix in their
style name.  "Section 5.3.3"_accelerate_kokkos.html gives details of
what hardware and software is required on your system, and how to
build and use this package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via
the "-sf kk" or "-suffix kk" "command-line
switches"_Section_start.html#start_7.  Also see the "GPU"_#GPU,
"OPT"_#OPT, "USER-INTEL"_#USER-INTEL, and "USER-OMP"_#USER-OMP
packages, which have styles optimized for CPUs, KNLs, and GPUs.

You must have a C++11 compatible compiler to use this package.

[Authors:] The KOKKOS package was created primarily by Christian Trott
and Stan Moore (Sandia), with contributions from other folks as well.
It uses the open-source "Kokkos library"_https://github.com/kokkos
which was developed by Carter Edwards, Christian Trott, and others at
Sandia, and which is included in the LAMMPS distribution in
lib/kokkos.

[Install or un-install:]

For the KOKKOS package, you have 3 choices when building.  You can
build with either CPU or KNL or GPU support.  Each choice requires
additional settings in your Makefile.machine for the KOKKOS_DEVICES
and KOKKOS_ARCH settings.  See the src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.kokkos*
files for examples.

For multicore CPUs using OpenMP:

KOKKOS_DEVICES = OpenMP
KOKKOS_ARCH = HSW           # HSW = Haswell, SNB = SandyBridge, BDW = Broadwell, etc

For Intel KNLs using OpenMP:

KOKKOS_DEVICES = OpenMP
KOKKOS_ARCH = KNL

For NVIDIA GPUs using Cuda:

KOKKOS_DEVICES = Cuda
KOKKOS_ARCH = Pascal60,Power8     # P100 hosted by an IBM Power8, etc
KOKKOS_ARCH = Kepler37,Power8     # K80 hosted by an IBM Power8, etc

For GPUs, you also need these 2 lines in your Makefile.machine before
the CC line is defined, in this case for use with OpenMPI mpicxx.  The
2 lines define a nvcc wrapper compiler, which will use nvcc for
compiling Cuda files or use a C++ compiler for non-Kokkos, non-Cuda
files.

KOKKOS_ABSOLUTE_PATH = $(shell cd $(KOKKOS_PATH); pwd)
export OMPI_CXX = $(KOKKOS_ABSOLUTE_PATH)/config/nvcc_wrapper
CC =		mpicxx

Once you have an appropriate Makefile.machine, you can
install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner.
Note that you cannot build one executable to run on multiple hardware
targets (CPU or KNL or GPU).  You need to build LAMMPS once for each
hardware target, to produce a separate executable.  Also note that we
do not recommend building with other acceleration packages installed
(GPU, OPT, USER-INTEL, USER-OMP) when also building with KOKKOS.

[Install or un-install:]

Building with this package requires a 1d FFT library be present on
your system for use by the PPPM solvers.  This can be the KISS FFT
library provided with LAMMPS, 3rd party libraries like FFTW, or a
vendor-supplied FFT library.  See step 6 of "Section
2.2.2"_Section_start.html#start_2_2 of the manual for details on how
to select different FFT options in your machine Makefile.

MEAM package :link(MEAM),h4

[Contents:]

A pair style for the modified embedded atom (MEAM) potential.

[Author:] Greg Wagner (Northwestern U) while at Sandia.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the
MEAM library in lib/meam.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the instructions in lib/meam/README.  You can also do it in one
step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which simply
invoke the lib/meam/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-meam                      # print help message
make lib-meam args="-m gfortran"   # build with GNU Fortran compiler
make lib-meam args="-m ifort"      # build with Intel ifort compiler :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/meam/libmeam.a and
lib/meam/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to link C++ (LAMMPS) with
Fortran (MEAM library).  Typically the two compilers used for LAMMPS
and the MEAM library need to be consistent (e.g. both Intel or both
GNU compilers).  If necessary, you can edit/create a new
lib/meam/Makefile.machine file for your system, which should define an
EXTRAMAKE variable to specify a corresponding Makefile.lammps.machine
file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-meam
make machine :pre

make no-meam
make machine :pre

NOTE: You should test building the MEAM library with both the Intel
and GNU compilers to see if a simulation runs faster with one versus
the other on your system.

MSCG package :link(mscg),h4

[Contents:]

A "fix mscg"_fix_mscg.html command which can parameterize a
Mulit-Scale Coarse-Graining (MSCG) model using the open-source "MS-CG
library"_mscg_home.

:link(mscg_home,https://github.com/uchicago-voth/MSCG-release)

To use this package you must have the MS-CG library available on your
system.

[Authors:] The fix was written by Lauren Abbott (Sandia).  The MS-CG
library was developed by Jacob Wagner in Greg Voth's group at the
University of Chicago.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first download and
build the MS-CG library.  Building the MS-CG library and using it from
LAMMPS requires a C++11 compatible compiler, and that LAPACK and GSL
(GNU Scientific Library) libraries be installed on your machine.  See
the lib/mscg/README and MSCG/Install files for more details.

Assuming these libraries are in place, you can do the download and
build of MS-CG manually if you prefer; follow the instructions in
lib/mscg/README.  You can also do it in one step from the lammps/src
dir, using a command like these, which simply invoke the
lib/mscg/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-mscg                                # print help message
make lib-mscg args="-g -b -l"                # download and build in default lib/mscg/MSCG-release-master
make lib-mscg args="-h . MSCG -g -b -l"      # download and build in lib/mscg/MSCG
make lib-mscg args="-h ~ MSCG -g -b -l"      # download and build in ~/mscg :pre

Note that the final -l switch is to create 2 symbolic (soft) links,
"includelink" and "liblink", in lib/mscg to point to the MS-CG src
dir.  When LAMMPS builds it will use these links.  You should not need
to edit the lib/mscg/Makefile.lammps file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-mscg
make machine :pre

make no-mscg
make machine :pre

performance on single or multiple cores.  These include EAM, LJ,
CHARMM, and Morse potentials.  The styles have an "opt" suffix in
their style name.  "Section 5.3.5"_accelerate_opt.html gives details
of how to build and use this package.  Its styles can be invoked at
run time via the "-sf opt" or "-suffix opt" "command-line
switches"_Section_start.html#start_7.  See also the "KOKKOS"_#KOKKOS,
"USER-INTEL"_#USER-INTEL, and "USER-OMP"_#USER-OMP packages, which

articulated body systems.  These are systems with multiple rigid
bodies (collections of particles) whose motion is coupled by
connections at hinge points.

[Author:] Rudra Mukherjee (JPL) while at RPI.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the
POEMS library in lib/poems.  You can do this manually if you prefer;

specified args:

make lib-colvars                      # print help message
make lib-colvars args="-m g++"        # build with GNU g++ compiler :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/colvars/libcolvars.a and
lib/colvars/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to build LAMMPS with the
COLVARS library (though typically the settings are just blank).  If
necessary, you can edit/create a new lib/colvars/Makefile.machine file
for your system, which should define an EXTRAMAKE variable to specify
a corresponding Makefile.lammps.machine file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-user-colvars
make machine :pre
 
make no-user-colvars
make machine :pre

USER-DPD package :link(USER-DPD),h4

[Contents:]

DPD stands for dissipative particle dynamics.  This package implements
coarse-grained DPD-based models for energetic, reactive molecular
crystalline materials.  It includes many pair styles specific to these
systems, including for reactive DPD, where each particle has internal
state for multiple species and a coupled set of chemical reaction ODEs
are integrated each timestep.  Highly accurate time intergrators for
isothermal, isoenergetic, isobaric and isenthalpic conditions are
included.  These enable long timesteps via the Shardlow splitting
algorithm.

USER-H5MD package :link(USER-H5MD),h4

[Contents:]

H5MD stands for HDF5 for MD.  "HDF5"_HDF5 is a portable, binary,
self-describing file format, used by many scientific simulations.
H5MD is a format for molecular simulations, built on top of HDF5.
This package implements a "dump h5md"_dump_h5md.html command to output
LAMMPS snapshots in this format.

:link(HDF5,http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5)

To use this package you must have the HDF5 library available on your
system.

[Author:] Pierre de Buyl (KU Leuven) created both the package and the
H5MD format.

[Install or un-install:]

Note that to follow these steps to compile and link to the CH5MD
library, you need the standard HDF5 software package installed on your
system, which should include the h5cc compiler and the HDF5 library.

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the
CH5MD library in lib/h5md.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the instructions in lib/h5md/README.  You can also do it in one
step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which simply
invoke the lib/h5md/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-h5md                     # print help message
make lib-hm5d args="-m h5cc"      # build with h5cc compiler :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/h5md/libch5md.a and
lib/h5md/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to build LAMMPS with the
system HDF5 library.  If necessary, you can edit/create a new
lib/h5md/Makefile.machine file for your system, which should define an
EXTRAMAKE variable to specify a corresponding Makefile.lammps.machine
file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:
  
make yes-user-h5md
make machine :pre
 
make no-user-h5md
make machine :pre

USER-INTEL package :link(USER-INTEL),h4

[Contents:]

Dozens of pair, fix, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and kspace
styles which are optimized for Intel CPUs and KNLs (Knights Landing).
All of them have an "intel" in their style name.  "Section
5.3.2"_accelerate_intel.html gives details of what hardware and
compilers are required on your system, and how to build and use this
package.  Its styles can be invoked at run time via the "-sf intel" or
"-suffix intel" "command-line switches"_Section_start.html#start_7.
Also see the "KOKKOS"_#KOKKOS, "OPT"_#OPT, and "USER-OMP"_#USER-OMP
packages, which have styles optimized for CPUs and KNLs.

You need to have an Intel compiler, version 14 or higher to take full
advantage of this package.

[Author:] Mike Brown (Intel).

[Install or un-install:]

For the USER-INTEL package, you have 2 choices when building.  You can
build with either CPU or KNL support.  Each choice requires additional
settings in your Makefile.machine for CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS and
optimized malloc libraries.  See the
src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.intel_cpu and src/MAKE/OPTIONS/Makefile.knl
files for examples.

For CPUs:

OPTFLAGS =      -xHost -O2 -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -qoverride-limits
CCFLAGS =	-g -qopenmp -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64 -no-offload \
                -fno-alias -ansi-alias -restrict $(OPTFLAGS)
LINKFLAGS =	-g -qopenmp $(OPTFLAGS)
LIB =           -ltbbmalloc -ltbbmalloc_proxy

For KNLs:

OPTFLAGS =      -xMIC-AVX512 -O2 -fp-model fast=2 -no-prec-div -qoverride-limits
CCFLAGS =	-g -qopenmp -DLAMMPS_MEMALIGN=64 -no-offload \
                -fno-alias -ansi-alias -restrict $(OPTFLAGS)
LINKFLAGS =	-g -qopenmp $(OPTFLAGS)
LIB =           -ltbbmalloc

Once you have an appropriate Makefile.machine, you can
install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the usual manner.
Note that you cannot build one executable to run on multiple hardware
targets (Intel CPUs or KNL).  You need to build LAMMPS once for each
hardware target, to produce a separate executable.

You should also typically install the USER-OMP package, as it can be
used in tandem with the USER-INTEL package to good effect, as
explained in "Section 5.3.2"_accelerate_intel.html.

USER-MOLFILE package :link(USER-MOLFILE),h4

[Contents:]

A "dump molfile"_dump_molfile.html command which uses molfile plugins
that are bundled with the "VMD"_vmd_home
molecular visualization and analysis program, to enable LAMMPS to dump
snapshots in formats compatible with various molecular simulation
tools.

:link(vmd_home,http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd)

To use this package you must have the desired VMD plugins available on
your system.

Note that this package only provides the interface code, not the
plugins themselves, which will be accessed when requesting a specific
plugin via the "dump molfile"_dump_molfile.html command.  Plugins can
be obtained from a VMD installation which has to match the platform
that you are using to compile LAMMPS for. By adding plugins to VMD,
support for new file formats can be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or other
programs that use them) without having to recompile the application
itself.  More information about the VMD molfile plugins can be found
at
"http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile"_http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile.

[Author:] Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U).

[Install or un-install:]
  
Note that the lib/molfile/Makefile.lammps file has a setting for a
dynamic loading library libdl.a that should is typically present on
all systems, which is required for LAMMPS to link with this package.
If the setting is not valid for your system, you will need to edit the
Makefile.lammps file.  See lib/molfile/README and

(http://ambermd.org/netcdf/nctraj.xhtml), but include extensions.

To use this package you must have the NetCDF library available on your
system.

Note that NetCDF files can be directly visualized with the following
tools:

"Ovito"_ovito (Ovito supports the AMBER convention and the extensions mentioned above)
"VMD"_vmd_home

:link(espresso,http://www.quantum-espresso.org)

To use this package you must have Quantum ESPRESSO available on your
system.

The current implementation only supports an ONIOM style mechanical
coupling to the Quantum ESPRESSO plane wave DFT package.
Electrostatic coupling is in preparation and the interface has been
written in a manner that coupling to other QM codes should be possible
without changes to LAMMPS itself.

[Author:] Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U).

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first build the
QMMM library in lib/qmmm.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the first two steps explained in lib/colvars/README.  You can
also do it in one step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like
these, which simply invoke the lib/colvars/Install.py script with the
specified args:

make lib-qmmm                      # print help message
make lib-qmmm args="-m gfortran"   # build with GNU Fortran compiler :pre

The build should produce two files: lib/qmmm/libqmmm.a and
lib/qmmm/Makefile.lammps.  The latter is copied from an existing
Makefile.lammps.* and has settings needed to build LAMMPS with the
QMMM library (though typically the settings are just blank).  If
necessary, you can edit/create a new lib/qmmm/Makefile.machine file

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-user-qmmm
make machine :pre
  
make no-user-qmmm

NOTE: The LAMMPS executable these steps produce is not yet functional
for a QM/MM simulation.  You must also build Quantum ESPRESSO and
create a new executable which links LAMMPS and Quanutm ESPRESSO
together.  These are steps 3 and 4 described in the lib/qmmm/README

[Author:] Albert Bartok (Cambridge University)

[Install or un-install:]

Note that to follow these steps to compile and link to the QUIP
library, you must first download and build QUIP on your systems.  It
can be obtained from GitHub.  See step 1 and step 1.1 in the

This package solves solids mechanics problems via a state of the art
stabilized meshless method with hourglass control.  It can specify
hydrostatic interactions independently from material strength models,
i.e. pressure and deviatoric stresses are separated.  It provides many
material models (Johnson-Cook, plasticity with hardening,
Mie-Grueneisen, Polynomial EOS) and allows new material models to be
added.  It implements rigid boundary conditions (walls) which can be
specified as surface geometries from *.STL files.

[Install or un-install:]

Before building LAMMPS with this package, you must first download the
Eigen library.  Eigen is a template library, so you do not need to
build it, just download it.  You can do this manually if you prefer;
follow the instructions in lib/smd/README.  You can also do it in one
step from the lammps/src dir, using a command like these, which simply
invoke the lib/smd/Install.py script with the specified args:

make lib-smd                            # print help message
make lib-smd args="-g -l"               # download in default lib/smd/eigen-eigen-*
make lib-smd args="-h . eigen -g -l"    # download in lib/smd/eigen
make lib-smd args="-h ~ eigen -g -l"    # download and build in ~/eigen :pre

Note that the final -l switch is to create a symbolic (soft) link
named "includelink" in lib/smd to point to the Eigen dir.  When LAMMPS
builds it will use this link.  You should not need to edit the
lib/smd/Makefile.lammps file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-user-smd
make machine :pre
  
make no-user-smd
make machine :pre

USER-SPH package :link(USER-SPH),h4

[Contents:]

An atom style, fixes, computes, and several pair styles which
implements smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for liquids.  See the
related "USER-SMD package"_#USER-SMD package for smooth Mach dynamics
(SMD) for solids.

This package contains ideal gas, Lennard-Jones equation of states,
Tait, and full support for complete (i.e. internal-energy dependent)
equations of state.  It allows for plain or Monaghans XSPH integration
of the equations of motion.  It has options for density continuity or
density summation to propagate the density field.  It has
"set"_set.html command options to set the internal energy and density
of particles from the input script and allows the same quantities to
be output with thermodynamic output or to dump files via the "compute
property/atom"_compute_property_atom.html command.

USER-VTK package :link(USER-VTK),h4

[Contents:]

A "dump vtk"_dump_vtk.html command which outputs
snapshot info in the "VTK format"_vtk, enabling visualization by
"Paraview"_paraview or other visuzlization packages.

:link(vtk,http://www.vtk.org)
:link(paraview,http://www.paraview.org)

To use this package you must have VTK library available on your
system.

[Authors:] Richard Berger (JKU) and Daniel Queteschiner (DCS Computing).

[Install or un-install:]
   
The lib/vtk/Makefile.lammps file has settings for accessing VTK files
and its library, which are required for LAMMPS to build and link with
this package.  If the settings are not valid for your system, check if
one of the other lib/vtk/Makefile.lammps.* files is compatible and
copy it to Makefile.lammps.  If none of the provided files work, you
will need to edit the Makefile.lammps file.

You can then install/un-install the package and build LAMMPS in the
usual manner:

make yes-user-vtk
make machine :pre
  
make no-user-vtk
make machine :pre
